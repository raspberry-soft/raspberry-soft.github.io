	<strong>Which tier should I get?</strong><br>
	If you want to play the latest update as soon as it's made, you should get the
	<strong>'MEGA FAN' tier</strong>. If you also want behind the scenes and CG previews, you should get the <strong>'VIP' tier</strong>.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How frequently do you update?<br>
	</strong>Monthly updates. Each update consists of more story and a minimum of 2 new hand-drawn 2D CG images. You can always check the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/67438811" target="_blank">Changelog</a>.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>At which hour of the day the update is posted?</strong><br>
	Usually around 21h00-23h00 Pacific Time. It may vary due to connectivity issues, last minute bug fixes and unforeseen events.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>What's the difference between Public and Patreon builds?</strong><br>
	Patreon builds contains the latest content regarding the story, always including new CG images. You need a password to unlock it.
	After 4 weeks it becomes public (Free) and you can find it on <a href="https://raspberrysoft.itch.io/indecent-wife-hana" target="_blank">itch.io</a><br>
	<br>
	<strong>What's on the Extras/Gallery Patch?</strong><br>
	You'll get access to:
	<ul>
		<li>An interactive <strong>'CG Image Gallery'</strong>, where you can see all the game images and modify some of them using buttons.</li>
		<li>A <strong>'Scene Gallery'</strong> lets you replay all the erotic scenes of the game.</li>
		<li>The <strong>'FLOW' Button / 'Scene Selector'</strong> screen lets you jump to any point of the story in-game.</li>
	</ul>
	The latest game version works with the latest patch version.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Why are blurred images in the game and how can I access them?</strong><br>
	These images represent the protagonist imagination, as part of the fetish is 'not knowing'. They will be unlocked after playing Hana POV, however, that part is
	<strong>NOT made yet.</strong><br>
	<br>
	<strong>What's the difference between the Gallery Patch and the CG Pack?</strong><br>
	The patch lets you access an in-game image & scene gallery, and the pack contains all the CG image files for you to download in HD (1080p) & game (600p) resolution.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>What's the Full-Body Character Set?</strong><br>
	You'll be able to download the characters complete (whole body) images with each expression/outfit combination. Hana & Yuma are available at the moment.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How do I get the VIP tier rewards?</strong><br>
	By pledging to the VIP tier you automatically get the VIP Discord role. You must vinculate your Discord account for this to work. The only way to claim the rewards is by joining the server.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong><strong>What are the 'Work-in-progress' game updates?</strong></strong><br>
	Is a version of the game with the latest content that it's incomplete and unpolished. You get to peek some new content before the actual final update release day or play test a new functionality. There are no set dates for this build to be posted. There are no guarantees for this build to be posted in a given month due to the nature of the development. If the build is posted I'll announce it on the patreon page if that's the only reason you want to pledge to this tier. You can recognize this build by the 'test' tag at the end of the game version.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>When are the CG previews posted?</strong><br>
	They will be posted on the discord server first as they are finished and ready to be shown, usually at the end of the month.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Can I get a refund?</strong><br>
	I only give refunds if the error is on my side. Please read the FAQ carefully before you pledge.
	<br>

	<strong>More questions?</strong><br>
